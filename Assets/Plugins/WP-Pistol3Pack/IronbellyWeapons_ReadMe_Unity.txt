Alloy-ONLY MATERIALS
There are materials in this pack that require the Alloy Shader:
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-44Mag/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_DIF_ALLOYONLY
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-44Mag/Meshes/Materials/44Mag_COL_ALLOYONLY
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-M9/Meshes/Materials/M9_COL_ALLOYONLY
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-TT/Meshes/Materials/TT_COL_ALLOYONLY
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-TT/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_Male1_COL_ALLOYONLY

For all users that do not have Alloy installed, these materials will appear a bright magenta and show Hidden/InternalErrorShader in the Inspector window.  In order to make use of these materials you need to purchase and install the Alloy Physical Shader Framework by heading over to https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11978 and importing it into your project.  

If you do not have Alloy, worry not, we have provided standard Unity 5 PBR materials as well that can be found in the same location and are missing the _ALLOYONLY tag on the end of the material name:
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-44Mag/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_DIF
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-44Mag/Meshes/Materials/44Mag_COL
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-M9/Meshes/Materials/M9_COL
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-TT/Meshes/Materials/TT_COL
/Assets/WP-Pistol3Pack/WP-TT/Meshes/Materials/FPArms_Male1_COL

These materials look awesome as well and will work perfectly with a stock Unity install.
